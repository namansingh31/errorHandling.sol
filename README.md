## Description
Error handling, a concept to handle errors or inspect routines to prevent errors or reverse it back to the initial stage in case an error happens, is used in this program, which is a contract in solidity.
It is an error-handling my_Unique_Bank smart contract that will serve as a foundation for my next endeavors.
